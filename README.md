Terraform module to create AWS `CodePipeline` with `CodeBuild` for CI/CD


This module can do the following:

1. Get a GitHub repository (public or private), build it by executing the ``buildspec.yml`` file from the repository, push the built artifact to an S3 bucket, 
and deploy the artifact to ``Elastic Beanstalk`` running any of the supported stacks (_e.g._ ``Java``, ``Go``, ``Node``, ``IIS``, ``Python``, ``Ruby``, etc.)

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-go-hw.html  


2. Get a ``GitHub`` repository, build a ``Docker`` image from it by executing the ``buildspec.yml`` and ``Dockerfile`` files from the repository, 
push the ``Docker`` image to an ``ECR`` repository, and deploy the ``Docker`` image to ``Elastic Beanstalk`` running ``Docker`` stack

## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```
module "build" {
    source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/tf_cicd.git?ref=tags/0.3.0"
    namespace           = "global"
    name                = "app"
    stage               = "staging"

    # Enable building and deploying automatically after pushing to the GitHub branch
    # If disabled, ``CodePipeline`` could be activated manually from the AWS console
    enabled             = true
    
    # Elastic Beanstalk
    app                 = "<Elastic Beanstalk application name>"
    env                 = "<Elastic Beanstalk environment name>"
    
    # Application repository on GitHub
    github_oauth_token  = "<GitHub Oauth Token with permissions to access private repositories>"
    repo_owner          = "<GitHub Organization or Person name>"
    repo_name           = "<GitHub repository name of the application to be built and deployed to Elastic Beanstalk>"
    branch              = "<Branch of the GitHub repository>"
   
    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref.html
    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html
    build_image         = "aws/codebuild/docker:1.12.1"
    build_compute_type  = "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"
   
    # These attributes are optional, used as ENV variables when building Docker images and pushing them to ECR
    # For more info:

    privileged_mode     = true
    aws_region          = "us-east-1"
    aws_account_id      = "xxxxxxxxxx"
    image_repo_name     = "ecr-repo-name"
    image_tag           = "latest"
}
```


For use-case #1 above, the ``buildspec.yml`` file could look like this 
> This is an example to build a Node app  

```
version: 0.2

phases:
  install:
    commands:
      - echo Starting installation ...
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Installing NPM dependencies...
      - npm install
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`

artifacts:
  files:
    - node_modules/**/*
    - public/**/*
    - routes/**/*
    - views/**/*
    - app.js
```  


For use-case #2 above, the ``buildspec.yml`` file looks like this  
> This is an example to build a ``Docker`` image for a Node app, push the ``Docker`` image to an ECR repository, and then deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk running ``Docker`` stack  

```
version: 0.2

phases:
  pre_build:
    commands:
      - echo Logging in to Amazon ECR...
      - $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_REGION)
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Build started on `date`
      - echo Building the Docker image...
      - docker build -t $IMAGE_REPO_NAME .
      - docker tag $IMAGE_REPO_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG
  post_build:
    commands:
      - echo Build completed on `date`
      - echo Pushing the Docker image to ECR...
      - docker push $AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.$AWS_REGION.amazonaws.com/$IMAGE_REPO_NAME:$IMAGE_TAG
