Terraform module to create AWS [`CodePipeline`](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/) with [`CodeBuild`](https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/) for [`CI/CD`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)

This module supports three use-cases:

1. **GitHub -> S3 (build artifact) -> Elastic Beanstalk (running application stack)**.
The module gets the code from a ``GitHub`` repository (public or private), builds it by executing the ``buildspec.yml`` file from the repository, pushes the built artifact to an S3 bucket,
and deploys the artifact to ``Elastic Beanstalk`` running one of the supported stacks (_e.g._ ``Java``, ``Go``, ``Node``, ``IIS``, ``Python``, ``Ruby``, etc.).

    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-nodejs-hw.html
    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-go-hw.html


2. **GitHub -> ECR (Docker image) -> Elastic Beanstalk (running Docker stack)**.
The module gets the code from a ``GitHub`` repository, builds a ``Docker`` image from it by executing the ``buildspec.yml`` and ``Dockerfile`` files from the repository,
pushes the ``Docker`` image to an ``ECR`` repository, and deploys the ``Docker`` image to ``Elastic Beanstalk`` running ``Docker`` stack.
    - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-docker.html


3. **GitHub -> ECR (Docker image)**.
The module gets the code from a ``GitHub`` repository, builds a ``Docker`` image from it by executing the ``buildspec.yml`` and ``Dockerfile`` files from the repository,
and pushes the ``Docker`` image to an ``ECR`` repository. This is used when we want to build a ``Docker`` image from the code and push it to ``ECR`` without deploying to ``Elastic Beanstalk``.
To activate this mode, don't specify the ``app`` and ``env`` attributes for the module.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "build" {
    source = "cloudposse/cicd/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
    namespace           = "eg"
    stage               = "staging"
    name                = "app"

    # Enable the pipeline creation
    enabled             = true

    # Elastic Beanstalk
    elastic_beanstalk_application_name = "<(Optional) Elastic Beanstalk application name>"
    elastic_beanstalk_environment_name = "<(Optional) Elastic Beanstalk environment name>"

    # Application repository on GitHub
    github_oauth_token  = "(Required) <GitHub Oauth Token with permissions to access private repositories>"
    repo_owner          = "<GitHub Organization or Person name>"
    repo_name           = "<GitHub repository name of the application to be built and deployed to Elastic Beanstalk>"
    branch              = "<Branch of the GitHub repository>"

    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref.html
    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html
    build_image         = "aws/codebuild/standard:2.0"
    build_compute_type  = "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"

    # These attributes are optional, used as ENV variables when building Docker images and pushing them to ECR
    # For more info:
    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-docker.html
    # https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/codebuild_project.html
    privileged_mode     = true
    region              = "us-east-1"
    aws_account_id      = "xxxxxxxxxx"
    image_repo_name     = "ecr-repo-name"
    image_tag           = "latest"

    # Optional extra environment variables
    environment_variables = [{
      name  = "JENKINS_URL"
      value = "https://jenkins.example.com"
    },
    {
      name  = "COMPANY_NAME"
      value = "Amazon"
    },
    {
      name = "TIME_ZONE"
      value = "Pacific/Auckland"
   }]
}
```
